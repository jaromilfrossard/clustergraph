# `clustergraph`

The developpement of clustergraph has stopped. Its functionality is in permuco4brain:

https://github.com/jaromilfrossard/permuco4brain.

This package is an add-on to permuco to compute cluster-mass test on space-time data.

If you want to use it now, a tutorial of the developpement version is available here:
